# Button_Led			
button and led control with stm32l073
   
PC13 -> GPIO_Input,
PA5 -> GPIO_Output


Hello there,

The process we will do in this application;
When I press the button once, I want the LED to light and when I press it again, I want the LED to turn off.
I prepared the code by specifying "count" value for this.
